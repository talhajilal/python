How to generate if and else statement with variables.
Here we will learn two paramenters for python. 

inputPassword = raw_input('Please Enter Password: ')   #### This raw_input function allow your script to obtain information before running this script. 

If you have access or your value match with secret , script will take you to next step. 

validPassword = 'secret' #this is our password.

inputPassword = raw_input('Please Enter Password: ')

if inputPassword == validPassword:
    print 'You have access!'
    
    
    Part two , 
    If you don't have access script will execute the following steps and exit without next step.
else:
    print 'Access denied!'
    sys.exit(0)

print 'Welcome!'
